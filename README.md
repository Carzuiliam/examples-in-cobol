# Examples of Sources in COBOL

This project just contains a set of examples of source codes using the COBOL language.

## Introduction

The codes presented in this project are:

- [**ODD_EVEN**](sources/ODD_EVEN.cobc), which verifies if an input is odd or even.

## Utilized Material

You can use any text editor (e.g. Notepad) to edit the given sources, and you may use the [online compiler from Tutorials Point's site](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cobol_online.php) or the [GnuCOBOL](https://open-cobol.sourceforge.io/) to test them -- note that some sources may require inputs (as STDIO or text files) to run correctly.

## Additional Info

First, COBOL is a very old language, so don't expect to find use of these codes on modern applications -- you may view them just for the sake of curiosity of how thing were programmed in the 60's, if you wish. 

Finally, since this is a work in progress, probably I will add more items in the future. Stay tuned!
